# Snowbound

(c) 2022 Matt Hogg

A simple canvas-based snow scene.

This started out as a C# project back in 2014 as a screensaver with a Christmas theme. It had the snow, yes as it does here, too. But it also had a spinning Santa head that I may or may not add to the project at a later date. However, it was also an attempt to write something very simple and short that gives the impression it has a whole lot more to it.

Now it is part of an Xcode project; I went to the Dark Side a number of years ago after getting fed-up with Windows. Initially this is designed for MacOS, but with some adaption this could be used on the other flavors, too.

Be in no doubt, this is not professional-state code, but I have included some commentary to help you understand what's happening. I'd not done any canvas-based coding within Xcode and this seemed a good place to start with something I'd already established before. Before using the Canvas I would have created each snowflake as a control, and figured out how to plonk it on the screen, but of course, MacOS and its siblings isn't particularly quick when it comes to hundreds of these controls on screen. The speed of the Canvas vs a collection of controls is quite remarkable.

Anyhoo, enough waffle. The code is there to be enjoyed, stolen, laughed at, etc. It's not earth-changing, so feel free to use it as you will. Also, cough, feel free to credit me...
